                                   btpd-cgi


This is an attempt to create a fast web interface for the BitTorrent Protocol
Daemon, using the C language and the CGI interface.

1. Dependencies
  * ClearSilver
  * libz
  * btpd sources in the btpd/ directory with its Makefile generated
  * libm
  * libcrypto (OpenSSL)

2. Build and install
  First, ensure that you have all dependencies as described in 1.

  To get the btpd sources you can :
    * use git submodules if you have clone the btpdcgi repository
    * download the latest tarball from the btpd website and extract it

  The build is configured by the config.mk file. You can edit it to fit your
  system or leave defaults. Then, it is the same old machinery:

  $ make
  $ make install

3. Configuration
  The btpdcgi configuration file is located in ${PREFIX}/etc/btpdcgi.conf
  The mandatories options are:

    * btpd_dir : path to the directory where the btpd socket live (the socket
      must be read/writable by the btpdcgi user)

    * torrents_dir : path to the directory where the .torrent files are saved
      (must be writable by the btpdcgi user)

    * content_dir : path to the directory where the downloaded files are saved
      (must by writable by the btpd user)

  Usually, the btpdcgi user is the same as httpd, say www.
  It is recommanded that btpd run with its own user.

  To restrict your btpdcgi installation, you can configure a HTTP authentication
  with your httpd server.

  The btpd.cgi file is located in ${PREFIX}/bin/ and the style.css file in
  ${PREFIX}/share/btpdcgi/static. You might want to add aliases rules so that
  your httpd can serve them.
